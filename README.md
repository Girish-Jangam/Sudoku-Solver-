# Sudoku Solver with Backtracking Algorithm Visualizer
The Sudoku Solver with Backtracking Algorithm Visualizer project is an interactive website that allows users to input a partially filled Sudoku puzzle and visualize how the backtracking algorithm works to solve it step-by-step. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop a Sudoku solver using backtracking algorithm and present it through an interactive website. The solver is designed to efficiently search for the correct solution by making educated guesses and backtracking when necessary. The website will provide an engaging and educational experience for anyone interested in learning about backtracking algorithms and Sudoku puzzles.

## Project Features

User-friendly interface for inputting Sudoku puzzles
Interactive visualization of backtracking algorithm in action
Step-by-step guide for solving Sudoku puzzles using backtracking algorithm
Educational tool for learning about backtracking algorithms and Sudoku puzzles
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for cross-platform compatibility

## How to Use

1. Access the website by visiting https://solve-sudoku.000webhostapp.com/
2. Input the partially filled Sudoku puzzle in the designated input boxes
3. Click on the "Solve" button to visualize the backtracking algorithm in action
4. Follow the step-by-step guide to understand how the algorithm works to solve the puzzle
5. Enjoy and learn!

## Future Plans

Implement additional Sudoku solving algorithms to provide a more comprehensive learning experience
Add more customization options for the visualization of the algorithm
Improve the user interface for a more seamless experience
Offer additional resources for learning about backtracking algorithms and Sudoku puzzles
